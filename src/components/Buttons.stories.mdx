# Buttons

Buttons are used to trigger actions within an application.
Button labels express what action will occur when the user interacts with it.

## Primary buttons

Primary buttons are used as a call to action and indicate the most important action on a page.

<Preview withToolbar>
  <Story name="primary">
    <PrimaryButton onClick={action('clicked')}>Hello world</PrimaryButton>
  </Story>
</Preview>

## Secondary buttons

Secondary buttons are the 'back' to the primary button's 'next', or the 'cancel' to the 'submit'. They provide users with an alternative to the primary action.

<Preview withToolbar>
  <Story name="secondary">
    <SecondaryButton>Hello world</SecondaryButton>
  </Story>
</Preview>

## Tertiary buttons

Tertiary buttons are usually used for miscellaneous actions: important actions that are not required immediately, such as 'edit', 'delete', 'add new'.

<Story name="tertiary">
  <TertiaryButton>Hello world</TertiaryButton>
</Story>
